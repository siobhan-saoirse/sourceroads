# Sourceroads: A source engine crossplay project

## What is this?

Sourceroads is an open-source crossplay project that allows multiple source engine games to connect to each other. The goal is to have a fully functioning sync server that communicates with dedicated servers for each game, allowing players and games to experience classic gamemodes and maps in a brand-new way.

## Features

### What can you do?

Not much right now, games can connect fine for the most part and you can see and kinda interact with other players, this project is very early in development and needs more time before you can do all too much.

### Feature list

* [x] Connect and network multiple game servers
* [x] See other players in real time.
* [ ] Interact with players (damage, contact, etc).
* [x] Communicate via Text Chat
* [ ] Communicate via Voice Chat
* [ ] See props/objects from other games.
* [ ] Syncronise gamemodes (ctf, cp, tdm, etc).
* [ ] Freely switch between maps.
* [ ] Ragdolls
